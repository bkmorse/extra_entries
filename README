{if count==total_results}
	{exp:extra_entries total_results="{total_results}" how_many_entries=""}
	  content you want to show in extra spots
	{/exp:extra_entries}
{/if}

total_results (required) = pass total_results tag within this
how_many_entries (required) = pass the number of how many times you want to loop it thru
