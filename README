Use as follows:

{if count==total_results}
	{exp:extra_entries total_results="{total_results}" how_many_entries=""}
	  content you want to show in extra spots
	{/exp:extra_entries}
{/if}

total_results (required) = pass total_results tag within this
how_many_entries (required) = pass the number of how many times you want to loop it thru

the content between the opening and closing tag is the html and/or content you want to display for the extra fields

Put the extra_entries folder into your system/expressionengine/third_party/ folder, so then you'll have system/expressionengine/third_party/extra_entries

To-do:

figure out how to display the content without having to wrap the plugin within {if count==total_results}plugin{/if}
